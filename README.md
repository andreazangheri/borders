<p><strong>BORDERS</strong></p><br>
</header>
<p>Borders is a multimedia project on languages and communication. It has been firstly developed in 2017 during the multimedia languages and multimedia design courses at the Department of Applied Arts of Urbino, BA in New Art Technologies. Overall Borders comprehend a product and editorial project and a progressive web application.</p>
<p>Boundaries as communicative incomprehension. Destructuration of signs: By subtracting meaning, subjects and signifieds from their daily cultural representation what remain is the cluster of sounds, images, plays and spaces generated in a self-powered and involontary nexus</p>
<p>Starting from semiotics, linguistics, sensorium and mass media topics, Borders is a graphic-phonetic experimentation and research on communicative boundaries and incommunicability.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank">product and editorial (link will be updated soon!)</a></p></li>
<p>The editorial project is composed of four books â€” 7x14 centimeters each, closed format. 
Fedrigoni X-PER 140 grams paper has been utilized for the inside pages and X-PER 320 grams board has been utilized for the softcover, both from Fedrigoni paper mills. Each book is 60 pages long and 0,5 centimeters thick.

The typeface utilized for the entire project is Noto Sans developed by Google.

The box containing the books is composed by two L shaped elements that form a square when combined. Both pieces have an intern groove as thick as the book in order to allow the insertion of the latter. The material utilized for the box is the medium-density fiberboard 5 millimeters thick covered by black all laminate 0,9 millimeter thick. The laminate has been utilized for its characteristic resistance to scratches and fingerprints.
Books have a functional role in the closure of the box since they permit its closure by friction. For this purpose, for each book it has been added a 220 grams paper cover from Fabriano paper mills in order to protect them from ruining when inserted and when extracted from the box.

A 7x7 centimeters closed format double gate fold brochure and a 50x70 centimeters poster has been designed for advertising and promotional purpose.

In 2017 Borders has been released in a limited edition of 3 copies.

<p>The application is based on HTML, CSS and JS. It has been developed using pure JavaScript, <a href="https://p5js.org/" alt="p5.js website">p5.js</a> core library and other p5 libraries, in particular: <a href="https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS/blob/master/src/rita.js" alt="p5.speech GitHub Reposityory">p5.speech</a> to access web speech and speech recognition APIs; <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/lib/addons/p5.sound.js" alt="p5.sound GitHub Repository">p5.sound</a> to extend audio input, analysis and synthesis; <a href="https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS/blob/master/src/rita.js" alt="rita.js github reposityory">rita.js</a>, which is a library for computational literature; <a href="https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS/blob/master/src/arpaToIPA.js" alt="arpaToIPA.js GitHub Reposityory">arpaToIPA.js</a> has been utilized to convert arpa alphabet to IPA alphabet. Graphic and sound outputs are displayed on the screen and emitted through speakers.

<p>What now is a web application started first as an interactive on-site installation capable of allowing interaction through voice recognition and motion recognition. Lately it has been redesigned and optimized to be accessible and fruible from the widest possible audicence and devices. Camera input has been removed while microphone is still a fundamental part of the project. The devices that support webKitSpeechRecognition (and related browsers' counterparts) will experience the application as intended while those devices that do not support this feature will not use the microphone as an input method but will be entertained anyway. Some minor issues are being looked into.</p>
