<p>Starting from semiotic, linguistic, sensorium and mass media topics, Borders is a multimedia project on communicative frontiers. Going beyond ritual and cultural dimensions, the project is placed, as far as possible, above any culture, thus summarizing
  them all. By subtracting meanings and subjects from their daily representation what remains is the cluster of sounds, images, plays and spaces generated in a self-powered and involuntary nexus.</p>
<p>
  Overall Borders comprehend a product and editorial project and a progressive web application.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>The application is based on HTML, CSS and JS. It has been developed using pure JavaScript, p5.js core library and other p5 libraries, in particular: p5.speech to access web speech and speech recognition APIs; p5.sound to extend audio input, analysis and
  synthesis; rita.js, which is a library for computational literature; arpaToIPA.js has been utilized to convert arpa alphabet to IPA alphabet. Graphic and sound outputs are displayed on the screen and emitted through speakers.
</p>
<p>The colors of the application interface vary according to the time of the day. There are four main input functions: ĭmāgo, sŏnus, lūdus and ārĕa. They all depict one of the four borders: images, sounds, games and spaces. Devices and browsers that do support
  webKitSpeechRecognition (and related counterparts) will permit to experience Borders at its full potential. Borders web application at its full is capable of voice and speech recognition which are then translated to the International Phonetic Alphabet
  before outputted on the screen and through the speakers. Phonemes, forms and graphics sizes vary based on the microphone input level. Meanwhile those devices and browsers that do not support this feature will not use the microphone as an input method
  but just touch inputs.</p>
