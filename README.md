<p><strong>BORDERS</strong></p><br>
</header>
<p>Starting from semiotic, linguistic, sensorium and mass media topics, Borders is an experimental graphic-phonetic web app on frontiers. Going beyond ritual and cultural dimensions, the project is placed, as far as possible, above any culture, thus summarizing them all. By subtracting meanings and subjects from their daily representation what remains is the cluster of sounds, images, plays and spaces generated in a self-powered and involuntary nexus.</p>
  Overall Borders comprehend a product and editorial project and a progressive web application. This project is the web design & web development part of the global Borders project, which is completed by the editorial product.

<p>The application is based on HTML, CSS and JS. It has been developed using pure JavaScript, <a href="https://p5js.org/" alt="p5.js website">p5.js</a> core library and other p5 libraries, in particular: <a href="https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS/blob/master/src/rita.js" alt="p5.speech GitHub Reposityory">p5.speech</a> to access web speech and speech recognition APIs; <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/lib/addons/p5.sound.js" alt="p5.sound GitHub Repository">p5.sound</a> to extend audio input, analysis and synthesis; <a href="https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS/blob/master/src/rita.js" alt="rita.js github reposityory">rita.js</a>, which is a library for computational literature; <a href="https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS/blob/master/src/arpaToIPA.js" alt="arpaToIPA.js GitHub Reposityory">arpaToIPA.js</a> has been utilized to convert arpa alphabet to IPA alphabet. Graphic and sound outputs are displayed on the screen and emitted through speakers.

<p>What now is a web application started first as an interactive on-site installation capable of allowing interaction through voice recognition and motion recognition. Lately it has been redesigned and optimized to be accessible and fruible from the widest possible audicence and devices. Camera input has been removed while microphone is still a fundamental part of the project. The devices that support webKitSpeechRecognition (and related browsers' counterparts) will experience the application as intended while those devices that do not support this feature will not use the microphone as an input method but will be entertained anyway.</p>
